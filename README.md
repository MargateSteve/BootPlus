# BootPlus

Extends the Bootstrap framework with a stack of extra colors and element styles.

> Note that this is still a very early version and is far from suitable for use on a production site. If you want to have a play around, you can find a compiled version called bootplus.css in the css folder. If you want to compile it yourself, copy the bootstrap-4.3.1 and scss folders to a location of your choice and compile scss/bootplus.scss. You can change some of what is output in scss/_settings.scss and reduce the number of colors (the main weight of the output css) in scss/_variables.scss
